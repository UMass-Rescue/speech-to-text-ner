on you i am honored to be with you to day for your commencement for one of the finest universities in the world tree be told ah i never graduated from college and this is the closest i've ever got into a college graduation to day i want to tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just three stories the first story is about connecting the dots i dropped out of red college after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop in for another eighteen months or so before i really quite so why i drop out it started before i was born my biological mother was a young unwedded student and she decided that put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so every thing was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who were on a waiting list got call in the middle of the night asking we got an unexpected baby boy you want him they said of course my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final adoption papers she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life and seventeen years later i did go to college but i naively chose a college there was almost as expensive stanford and all of my work in class parents save in would being spent on my college tuition after six months i couldn't see the value in it i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out and here i was spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life so i decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting it wasn't all romantic i didn't have a dormer so i slept on a floor and friends rooms i returned cobles for the five cent deposits to buy food with and i would walk the seven miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal a week at the harry christiane i loved it and much of what i stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example red college at that time offered perhaps the best caligraphy struction in the country throughout the campus every poster every label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed because i had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes i decided to take a legerity class to learn how to do this i learned about sarah finance a tight faces about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes a great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture and i found it fascinating none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life but ten years later when we were designing the first mackintosh computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the man it was the first computer with beautiful typography if i had never dropped the in on that single course in college the mac would have never had multiple typeface or proportionally space thoughts and since windows just copied the mack it's likely that no person a computer would have them if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that collegians and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards ten years later again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dogs will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life care whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road we'll give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path and that will make all the difference my second story is about love and loss i was lucky i found what i love to do early in life was an i started apple in my parents rage when i was twenty we worked hard and in ten years apple a groan from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employes we just released our finest creation the mackintosh a year earlier and i just turned thirty and then i got fired how can you get fired from a company who started well as apple grew we hired some one who i thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year or so things went well but then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out when we did our board of directors sided with him and so at thirty i was out and very publicly out what had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating i really didn't know what to do for a few months i felt that i had left the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that i had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me i met with david packard and bob noise and tried to apologize for spring up so badly i was a very public failure and i even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to dawn on me i still loved what i did the turn of events had apple had not changed that one bit i'd been rejected but i was still in love and so i decided to start over i didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing he could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life during the next five years i started a company named next another company named picar and fell in love in an amazing woman who would become my wife pica went on a creed the world's first computer animated feature film poitry and is now the most successful animation studio in the world the inerrable turn of events all bought next and i return to apple and the technology we developed it next is at the heart of apples part renaissance and marine and i have a wonderful family together i'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadn't been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it my third story is about death when i was seventeen i read a quote that went something like if you live each day as if it was your last some day you'll most certainly be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past thirty three years i have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if the day were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do to day and whenever the answers the knoll for too many days in a row i know any to change something remembering that all be dead soon is the most important tool it ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment of failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart about a year ago i was diagnosed with cancer i had a scan at seven thirty in the morning and a clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas i didn't even know what a pancreas was the doctor told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that i should expect to live no longer than three to six months my doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order which is doctors code for prepared a dye it means the try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months in means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that we'll be is easiest possible for your family it means to say you're good bye i live with that diagnosis all day later that evening i had a biopsy where they stuck an endicott through my stomach and into my intestine put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor i was to dated but my wife who was there told me that when they view the cells on remarked the doctor started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery i had the surgery and thankfully i'm fine now this was the closest i've been to facing death and i hope it's the closest i get for a few more decades having lived through it i can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there and yet that is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely to single best invention of life its life's change agents it clears out the old to make way for the new right now the new is you but some day not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away start be so dramatic but it's quite true you are time is limited so don't waste it living some one else's life don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people thinking don't let the noise of others opinions drowned out your own intervale and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary when i was young there was an amazing publication called the whole earth catalogue which was one of the bibles of my generation it was created by a fellow named starbd not far from here and mellor and he brought it to life with his poetic touch this was in the late sixties before personal computers and destouches so what was all made with typewriters scissors and polarities it was sort of like google and paper back for him thirty five years before google came along it was idealistic overflowing with me tools and great notions store in his team put out several issues of the holata along and then one it had run its course they put out a final issue it was the mid nineteen seventies and i was your age on the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road the kind you might find yourself hitch hiking on if you were so adventurous beneath it were the words stay hungry stay foolish it was their farewell message as they signed off stay hungry stay foolish and i have always wished that for myself and now as you graduate to begin a new i wish that for you stay hungry stay foolish thank you all very much mcdonalds stock went up, but apple isn't doing so well despite the recent iphone sales roger federer lost in the finals of atp dubai yet again but this year was especially bad since kobe bryant passed away in march
